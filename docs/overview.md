# Overview
**Note:** This section is optional.

This repository is a template for thesis projects based on ROS 2.

It provides:
- a ROS 2 workspace (`ros2_ws`)
- an example Python package (`hello_world`)
- a structured documentation directory (`docs/`) organized by package.

The student is expected to:
- use this template as a starting point
- add new ROS 2 packages in `ros2_ws/src/`
- keep the documentation in `docs/` synchronized with the code.
